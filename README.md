# CBL
Code for CBL 1.0

The model is described in detail in: McCauley, S.M. & Christiansen, M.H. (in press). Language learning as language use: A cross-linguistic model of child language development. Psychological Review.

Work resulting from using the code here should cite this paper.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to run the CBL model on an input corpus, the corpus must be appropriately cleaned/prepared. 

The folder "Sample Corpora" includes detailed instructions for corpus preparation, along with a sample corpus ("anne_excerpt.capp"). 

The same folder includes instructions for creating the "gold standard" shallow parse used to evaluate the model's shallow parsing performance, 
along with an example of a gold standard file.
