# CBL
Code for CBL 1.0

In order to run the CBL model on an input corpus, the corpus must be appropriately cleaned/prepared. 

The folder "Sample Corpora" includes detailed instructions for corpus preparation, along with a sample corpus ("anne_excerpt.capp"). 

The same folder includes instructions for creating the "gold standard" shallow parse used to evaluate the model's shallow parsing performance, 
along with an example of a gold standard file.
