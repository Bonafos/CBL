A sample excerpt of a shallow parsed corpus is provided. See paper for discussion of the shallow parsers used for English, French, and German.

1) Prior to running the shallow parser on the corpus, remove speaker ID tags from the cleaned corpus
2) Following shallow parsing, remove chunk tags (e.g., NP, VP, etc.)
3) Mark all chunk boundaries with " || " -- see the example provided (anne.parsed)
